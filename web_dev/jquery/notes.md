## Plan Jquery
* 30 min - Find a video on jquery basics
* 10 min - Find cheat sheet for jquery, review a couple of them and compare differences
* 30 min - Review the cheat sheet and use google to take a deep dive into some of the items
* 50 min - Use the chameleon project to test out some of the new found jquery knowledge


## After session notes
* I think my strategy worked out pretty well. I had a nice mix of sources that helped me to learn about jquery in a relatively short period of time
* I wouldn't identify a single resource as being more effective than another 
* The video turtorials were useful because it gave me a starting point for terminology to search for in the following steps
* The self practice and cheatsheets were also very useful because it gave me practical experience with jquery and help me learn to troubleshoot issues as I ran into them
