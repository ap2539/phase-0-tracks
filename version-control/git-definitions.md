# Git Definitions

**Instructions ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

> Version control allows us to track revisions that have been made by different people. The history of revisions is viewable and it is possible revert one or more files back to previous state. Version control is useful because it helps us to maintain a working project by ensuring that the original code keeps its integrity even when multiple revisions by different people are being made at the same time. This done by tracking all revisions and eventually merging those revisions back into the master. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

> A branch is of shoot of the master project. It allows a person to make changes to the project without disturbing its integrity. Branches must be reviewed and merged and merged back into the master tracking all changes that have been made to branch.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

> A commit is a save point. Once all chnages are confirmed made by a person those revisions will be set into the branch and the person will then need to comment on the what has changed in their edits fir tracking purposes. A good commit messages is detailed and states what has changed since the previous commit. 

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when git finds that the same line in the same file. Git my not know how to properly merge the files. In this case a user should review the conflict and make the necessary edits to resolve.
